# AWS OpsWorks with Chef for User Management on EC2 Instances

This repository provides a solution using AWS OpsWorks and Chef to automate the creation of login information for a new employee on multiple EC2 instances. This approach ensures consistent user management and configuration across your AWS infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following set up:

- AWS account with access to AWS OpsWorks.
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions to interact with AWS resources.
- Basic knowledge of AWS OpsWorks, Chef, and Git.

## Steps to Use

### Step 1: Set Up AWS OpsWorks Stack

1. **Create a Stack**:
   - Navigate to the AWS OpsWorks console.
   - Click on "Add stack" and select "Chef 12 Stack".
   - Configure the stack settings with a name and region.

2. **Add a Layer**:
   - After creating the stack, click on "Add layer".
   - Choose the "Custom" layer type.
   - Configure the layer settings and click "Add layer".

### Step 2: Create and Upload the Chef Cookbook

1. **Create a Chef Cookbook**:
   - Clone this repository or create a new one for your Chef cookbook.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/add_user_opsworks.git
   cd add_user_opsworks
   ```

2. **Define the Recipe**:
   - Inside the `recipes` folder, create a `default.rb` recipe to add the new user. Modify it as needed:

   ```ruby
   # recipes/default.rb
   user 'new_employee' do
     comment 'New Employee'
     shell '/bin/bash'
     home '/home/new_employee'
     manage_home true
     action :create
   end

   directory '/home/new_employee/.ssh' do
     owner 'new_employee'
     group 'new_employee'
     mode '0700'
     action :create
   end

   file '/home/new_employee/.ssh/authorized_keys' do
     owner 'new_employee'
     group 'new_employee'
     mode '0600'
     content 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3... new_employee_key'
     action :create
   end
   ```

3. **Upload the Cookbook to OpsWorks**:
   - Package your cookbook into a tarball:

   ```bash
   tar -czvf add_user.tar.gz add_user
   ```

   - Upload the cookbook to an S3 bucket or directly to OpsWorks through the console.

### Step 3: Configure OpsWorks to Use the Cookbook

1. **Specify the Cookbook Source**:
   - In the OpsWorks console, go to your stack.
   - Click on "Stack Settings" and then "Edit".
   - Under "Custom Cookbooks", specify the source of your cookbook (e.g., the S3 URL or a Git repository).

2. **Set Up the Configure Lifecycle Event**:
   - Go to the layer that you created.
   - Click on "Recipes" and then "Configure".
   - Add `add_user::default` to the list of recipes to be executed during the Configure lifecycle event.

### Step 4: Manage EC2 Instances

1. **Add Instances**:
   - In your OpsWorks stack, go to "Instances".
   - Click "Add instance" and configure the instance settings.
   - Launch the instance.

2. **Deploy and Configure**:
   - Once the instance is running, OpsWorks will automatically apply the `add_user` recipe during the Configure lifecycle event. This ensures that the new employee's login information is created on the instance.

### Summary

By using AWS OpsWorks with Chef, you can automate the process of creating login information for a new employee on all your EC2 instances in a standardized and efficient manner. This repository provides a clear guide to setting up and using OpsWorks and Chef for user management across your AWS infrastructure.
