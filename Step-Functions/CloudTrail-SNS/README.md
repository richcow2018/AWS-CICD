WS Step Functions are designed to handle such complexities more gracefully than a Lambda function alone. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide on how to implement this solution:

Step-by-Step Implementation
### 1. Create a CloudWatch Event Rule
Navigate to CloudWatch:

Go to the AWS Management Console and open CloudWatch.
Create a New Rule:

Go to Events > Rules.
Click Create rule.
Under Event Source, select Event Source and choose AWS Health.
In the Event Type field, select AWS_RISK_CREDENTIALS_EXPOSED.
Add Target:

Under Targets, choose Step Functions state machine.
Select the state machine you will create in the next steps.

### 2. Create a Step Functions State Machine

#### 1. Navigate to Step Functions:

Go to the AWS Management Console and open Step Functions.

#### 2. Create a New State Machine:

Click Create state machine.
Choose a Standard state machine (not Express) to handle retries and maintain an audit trail.

#### 3. Define the State Machine:

Use the Amazon States Language (ASL) to define your state machine. Here is an example definition that includes steps for IAM, CloudTrail, and SNS:

### 3. Create the Lambda Functions
For each step in your state machine, create a corresponding Lambda function. 

#### 1. Invoke IAM Function:
Go to the AWS Lambda console.
Create a new Lambda function named InvokeIAMFunction.

#### 2. Invoke CloudTrail Function:
Create another Lambda function named InvokeCloudTrailFunction.

#### 3. Invoke SNS Function:
Create another Lambda function named InvokeSNSFunction.

#### 4. Add Permissions to Lambda Functions
Ensure each Lambda function has the necessary IAM roles and policies to access IAM, CloudTrail, and SNS services.

1. Go to IAM Console:
- Create a new role with a policy that grants the necessary permissions for each service.
- Attach this role to your Lambda functions.

#### 5. Link CloudWatch Event Rule to Step Functions
Return to CloudWatch Event Rule:
Set the target to the state machine you created.
